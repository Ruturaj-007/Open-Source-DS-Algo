Prim's Algorithm - Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
-------------------------------------------------
This script implements Prim's Algorithm using a
priority queue (min-heap) to find the MST of a
connected, undirected, weighted graph.

Time Complexity:
    O(E log V) — where E is the number of edges
    and V is the number of vertices.

Space Complexity:
    O(V + E) — for storing adjacency list and visited nodes.

    Function to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
