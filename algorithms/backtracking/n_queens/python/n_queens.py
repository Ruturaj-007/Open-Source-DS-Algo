def solve_n_queens(n):
    """
    Solve the N-Queens problem using the Backtracking algorithm.

    Problem Overview:
    ------------------
    Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
    Threats occur when queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

    Backtracking Approach:
    ----------------------
    1. Place one queen in each row (starting from row 0).
    2. For each row, try every column to find a safe position.
    3. If a column is safe:
        a. Place the queen.
        b. Recurse to the next row to place the next queen.
    4. If no valid column exists for the current row, backtrack:
        a. Remove the last placed queen.
        b. Try the next column in the previous row.
    5. Continue until all queens are placed (base case), then record the solution.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    n : int
        The size of the chessboard and number of queens.

    Returns:
    --------
    List[List[str]]
        A list of all valid solutions.
        Each solution is a list of strings where 'Q' denotes a queen and '.' an empty cell.

    Time Complexity: O(N!)
        - Each row has at most N choices, with pruning via the is_safe check.
    Space Complexity: O(N^2)
        - Board storage and recursion stack.
    """

    def is_safe(board, row, col):
        """
        Determine if it's safe to place a queen at board[row][col].

        Checks performed:
        1. Column: Ensure no queen exists in the same column in previous rows.
        2. Upper-left diagonal: Ensure no queen exists in the diagonal running from top-left to bottom-right.
        3. Upper-right diagonal: Ensure no queen exists in the diagonal running from top-right to bottom-left.

        Returns True if all checks pass, False otherwise.

        Recursive Logic:

        - Base Case: All rows are filled successfully.

        - Recursive Case:
            1. Loop through each column in current row.
            2. Check if position is safe using is_safe.
            3. If safe:
