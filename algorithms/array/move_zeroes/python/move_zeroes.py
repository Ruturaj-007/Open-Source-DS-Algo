move_zeroes.py

A Python program to move all zeroes in a list to the end
while keeping the order of the other (non-zero) elements the same.

This operation is done in-place, meaning we modify the same list
instead of creating a new one.

    Moves all zeros in the given list to the end, in-place.

    Returns:
        None: The list is modified directly (no new list is returned)

üß† Explanation Summary:
-----------------------
1Ô∏è‚É£ We maintain a pointer (insert_pos) to decide where to put the next non-zero.
2Ô∏è‚É£ We scan each element:
    - If non-zero ‚Üí swap it to insert_pos, move insert_pos forward.
    - If zero ‚Üí skip it.
3Ô∏è‚É£ At the end, all non-zeros are in front, and all zeros move behind automatically.

‚è± Time Complexity: O(n)
   ‚Üí We visit each element once.

üíæ Space Complexity: O(1)
   ‚Üí We don't use extra memory (operation is done in-place).
