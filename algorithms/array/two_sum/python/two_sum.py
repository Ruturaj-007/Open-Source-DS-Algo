"""
Time Complexity: O(n)
We iterate through the list of n elements only once. Each lookup and
insertion in the hash map takes constant time on average, O(1).

Space Complexity: O(n)
In the worst-case scenario, we might store all n elements in the
hash map if the solution pair is found at the very end or not at all.
