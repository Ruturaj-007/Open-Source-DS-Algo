Algorithms
==========

This folder contains implementations of common algorithms across languages. Algorithms are deterministic procedures for solving problems (e.g., sorting, searching, traversals).

Categories
----------
- sorting
- searching
- string
- math

Contributing
------------
1. Create a subfolder under `algorithms/<category>/<algorithm>/<language>/`.
2. Add your implementation file with comments explaining the logic and time/space complexity.
3. Follow the repository's contribution guidelines and submit a single, focused PR.
